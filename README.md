4. Submit via the method outlined in [How to Submit Your Project](#how-to-submit-your-project).

## Directory Structure
Your project directory should have the following structure:


### File Descriptions
- **app.py**: Streamlit application file that loads the model, accepts user input, and displays predictions.
- **bank.py**: Python file with helper functions for data processing.
- **loan_model.pkl**: Pickle file containing the serialized ML model.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all required libraries and dependencies to run the project.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
- **notebooks/Untitled.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

## How to Submit Your Project
1. **Create a GitHub repository** (public or private).
2. Add all project files to the repository.
3. Push your changes to GitHub.
4. Share the repository link as instructed or add collaborators as needed.

## Project Requirements
The project should meet the following requirements:
1. **Machine Learning Model**: Include a trained model capable of predicting loan risk.
2. **Streamlit Integration**: Provide a Streamlit app for easy user interaction with the model.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure data is preprocessed effectively for the model.
4. **Documentation**: Complete this README with accurate project descriptions.
5. **Dependencies**: List all required libraries in `requirements.txt`.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your project will be evaluated based on:
- **Accuracy and Performance of the Model**: How well the model performs in predicting loan risk.
- **Functionality of the Streamlit App**: Ease of use, responsiveness, and user experience of the app.
- **Code Quality**: Organization, readability, and maintainability of your code.
- **Documentation**: Completeness and clarity of the README and other documentation files.
- **Adherence to Requirements**: Following the directory structure and submission guidelines.
